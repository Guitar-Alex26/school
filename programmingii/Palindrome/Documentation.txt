Lesson learned? I would consider myself somewhat learned already: my previous experience in leisure and in class programming lead me to utilizing tools I'm familiar with.
No bugs or errors I've found in my code as of 1:26AM, 7/22.

P.S. I LOVE using Visual Studio Code, I hope that's okay. If not, I would be more than happy to drop it into Eclipse if you'd prefer that.
P.P.S. I'm doing this assignment right after the first one I did; again, if you'd prefer my responses in a Word document, I can do that. No problem.
Thank you again for your patience on my late assignments.
